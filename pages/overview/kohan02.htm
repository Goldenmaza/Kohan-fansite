						Faction units
					</h1>
					<p>
						The Wizard unit cast lightning bolts from the top of their staff. This is very destructive against the undead race because of their vulnarbility
						against Magic Attacks. This is also very usefull against Humans because of the devastating effect it has on their weak moral.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						The Royalist faction have the Paladin unit which is a heavily armored warrior saddeld on an equally armored horse, the unit also
						carries around a huge sword which causes Magic Attacks which can be most effective against the Undead. The Paladin also gives Inspiration to all the
						units in the company.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						The Nationalist faction have the Zealot unit, a female sorceress that increases the health (+30%) of the entire company, for 30
						seconds. The Zealot also cast; Wash of Pain on the enemy.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						The Ceyah faction have the Prophet unit which is a healer and cast Life Leech at the enemy. It uses the life, it drained from the
						enemy, by what he gained from the Life Leech cast, to heal a single unit in the company.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						The Fallen faction have the Dreadlord, which provides Bloodlust to the company it's assigned to; it gives +3 in Attack Value.
