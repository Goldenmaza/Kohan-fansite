					<p>
						You have just entered the designs section, below you can find six images that represent six of my creations,
						collected from both of the subsections.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						There are two subsections; <strong>Scenario</strong> and <strong>Campaign</strong>. A scenarioized means that
						they have a small task for you to do. It can be things from capturing a tower to using portals to get behind enemy lines.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						A campaign means a group of maps that has been put together to create something special
						for you to experience. Each campaign has it's own story, with influences from the orginal story, at of this moment there
						is only one campaign and I am still working on it.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						On the next page you will find the <em>Scenario</em> creations and on the page after that you will find
						the first <em>Campaign</em> of six, that I am working on.
