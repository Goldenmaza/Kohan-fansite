					<h1>
						The Undead race
					</h1>
					<p>
						The Undead are alittle different from the other races, mainly because they have the ability to heal anywhere. They
						aren't bound to the supply zone, as the other races. That makes them very dangerous, especially in the beginning of
						a game.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						They are however a weak race, once the game continues and heavier companies are being recruited,
						even with full researched tech and at full health. The Undead lacks the proper support units that would be needed for
						a long game.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						On the next page you can find a list of all units that are being used by the Undead race.
