						Support units
					</h1>
					<p>
						On this page you can find a list of all support units that are being used by
						the Shadow race. These three units are also the leaders of the company that they
						are placed on. That is the difference between the Shadow race and the others. With
						other words they have no traditional support units and a leader. For the Shadow
						race, they are one and the same. The remaining units can be found on the next page..
