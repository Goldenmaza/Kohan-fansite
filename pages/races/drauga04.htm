					<p>
						On this page you can find a list of all other units that are being used by
						the Drauga race, the Packbeast unit is special in the case it can not be used
						as a frontline element, just like with the Ox unit for the Human race. Instead
						they are automaticly placed as flanks, on companies that have a frontline containing
						of Settlers.
