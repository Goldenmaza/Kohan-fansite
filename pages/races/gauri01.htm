						The Gauri race
					</h1>
					<p>
						The Gauri race have very strong infantry and cavalry elements, even some of their support are a mouthful to defend
						against. The downside of this strength is that it takes a while for them to get anywhere. Their weakness, obviously,
						is their speed. Incase you wanna defeat an army, of stone crushing Gauri, it is very important to know how to flank
						against certain elements.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						Since their speed is their initial flaw, you have to maintain a supply line, so they dont
						have to run all over the map to regain their strength. To do this you have to be building Gauri forts on the way to
						your enemy settlements, their forts will not only be a very good defensive position but they will also let the Gauri
						companies regain their numbers after a battle.
					</p>
					<p class="paraIndent">
						On the next page you can find a list of all units that are being used by the Gauri race.
